# Item-Recommendation
 "A recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their behavior, preferences, and segmentation. This project utilizes machine learning techniques such as clustering to analyze user data and provide personalized content."

# Personalized Content Recommendation System

This project implements a **Personalized Content Recommendation System** that suggests items to users based on their behavior, preferences, and segmentation. The system analyzes user interactions with various types of content, identifies user preferences, and recommends content in a dynamic launcher to enhance user engagement and retention.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

**Goal:**  
The main objective of this project is to increase user engagement by offering personalized content recommendations. By understanding user behavior and preferences, we can improve the user experience and increase retention by presenting relevant items.

**Approach:**  
We employ a machine learning-based approach, particularly **clustering algorithms**, to group users with similar tastes. By categorizing content (e.g., based on genre, country, and type), and analyzing user interactions, the system identifies the most relevant content for each user. These recommendations are then displayed in a personalized format on the launcher.

## üìà Methodology

### 1. **Data Preparation**  
We gather two types of data for this project:
- **Content Data:**  
  Information on each piece of content such as genre, country, rating, and type, as well as user engagement metrics like views and play counts.
  
- **User Data:**  
  Data on user interactions with content. This includes a matrix where each row corresponds to a user, and the columns represent categories of content. The values indicate how many items from each category a user has watched.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Normalization**  
After collecting the raw data, we perform several preprocessing steps:
- Removing noise and missing values.
- Standardizing features to prepare for clustering.

### 3. **User Clustering (K-Means Algorithm)**  
To classify users based on their content consumption behavior, we use **K-Means clustering**:
- The **Elbow Method** is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).  
- Once K is identified, users are grouped into K clusters, where users in each cluster share similar preferences.
- The system assigns each user to the cluster whose centroid best matches their profile.

### 4. **Content Recommendation**  
For each cluster, we determine the top content categories based on the **centroid** of that cluster. Users within a cluster are then recommended content from those categories. Additionally, a prioritized array of preferences is created for each user to offer multiple recommendations.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Categorization of Content**  
   - Each piece of content is grouped based on its genre, country, type, and user engagement metrics.
   - For instance, all Iranian comedy movies may form one category, while thrillers from international countries may form another.

2. **User Segmentation**  
   - Using K-Means clustering, users are segmented into groups based on their viewing history.
   - We apply a data-driven method to find optimal cluster sizes (K = 5 in this case) and classify users accordingly.

3. **Recommendation System**  
   - For each user, the system identifies the best-matching content category and provides recommendations in a dynamic launcher interface.
   - Users may also receive a prioritized list of preferences based on secondary tastes.

## üìä Results

The final output of this project consists of:
1. **User and Content Mapping:**  
   A file containing the relationship between users and the content categories they are most likely to prefer.
   
2. **Centroid Information:**  
   A file showing the centroids for each user cluster, indicating the central preferences of each group and the number of users in each cluster.
   
3. **Feature Similarity (Jaccard Index):**  
   A file showing the similarity between different features across the dataset using the **Jaccard similarity index**. This helps us understand which features are most related to each other in the clustering process.
